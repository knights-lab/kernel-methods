# kernel-methods
Evaluation and development of kernel methods for microbiome classification

The goals of this project are two-fold. One is to examine and compare the predictive performance of various kernel-based methods on variables of a number of datasets used by Knights lab. The other is to explore new kernels with tunable parameters based on ecological distance metrics.
