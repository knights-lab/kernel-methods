# kernel-methods
Evaluation and development of kernel methods for microbiome classification

The goals of this project are two-fold. One is to examine and compare the predictive performance of various kernel-based methods on variables of a number of datasets used by Knights lab. The other is to explore new kernels with tunable parameters based on ecological distance metrics. 

<h3> System Overview </h3>
<p>The kernel-methods project employs R scripts to run cross-validated predictive performance analysis of the classification of variables of different dataset otu files. In english, it means for example we want to see how well different kernel-methods can predict the value of a certain variable (eg whether or not you are obese) based on your microbiota. </p>
